- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sticky6ramira, coming from Croatia, with an abundance of coffe in front of me :)
- 👀 I’m interested in development, AI, how things work in general and how to create stuff, virtual and IRL.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS; javascript, Ruby on Rails in my free time and Python, R and SQL in my free "free" time ;)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... basically anything, used to program BASIC and C++ (a little bit) back until I was 15, then stopped all of a sudden,
 I was multiple county champion in BASIC programming (2006, '07, '08), even been to state championship 2 times... 2007 ICPC gold medal for participation ;)
 First, I need to get back on track, after that I'll work on anything...
 I have a few ideas (app's and software) and projects I want to make come true during my lifetime, 
and all the acquaintances, experience and knowledge I find on the way will be welcomed!
- 📫 How to reach me... I'll be checking GIT often as I am returning to the excellence of programming and development, and you can send me an e-mail to love.pilot4u@gmail.com (It's OG, right :) )

P.S. Huge motorcycle enthusiast, all kinds of music, history lover (especially WWII),
 IPSC and firearms customization enthusiast (on paper really at this point), burger addict... and really down to earth and good guy in general.
